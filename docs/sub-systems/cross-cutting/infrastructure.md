# Infrastructure Architecture and Deployment

**Cross-Cutting Infrastructure Design for Serverless Analytics Platform**

## Overview

The Infrastructure subsystem provides the foundational AWS resources and deployment automation required to support the Prism analytics platform. It encompasses multi-region resource provisioning, network architecture, Lambda deployment orchestration, and cross-service configuration management.

## Infrastructure as Code Architecture

### Terraform Module Organization

The infrastructure follows a hierarchical module structure that enables regional deployment consistency while supporting environment-specific customization. The organization separates global resources from regional resources, allowing independent scaling and maintenance of each deployment region.

**Global Infrastructure Module**: Manages resources that span multiple regions including CloudFront distributions, DynamoDB Global Tables for tenant registry, Route 53 hosted zones, and Lambda@Edge functions for global routing. This module establishes the foundation for multi-region tenant routing and ensures consistent global resource naming and tagging.

**Regional Infrastructure Module**: Provisions region-specific resources including VPC networks, Lambda functions, EFS filesystems, Aurora clusters, S3 buckets, and API Gateway deployments. Each regional module operates independently while conforming to global naming conventions and security policies.

**Service-Specific Modules**: Individual modules for each subsystem (ingest, query, catalog, storage, security, sharding) that provision service-specific resources while maintaining proper dependency relationships and configuration consistency.

### Resource Dependency Management

The infrastructure design carefully manages resource dependencies to enable reliable provisioning and updates. Aurora clusters are provisioned before Lambda functions that depend on them, EFS filesystems are created and configured before Lambda functions mount them, and API Gateway deployments occur after all backend services are operational.

Cross-service dependencies are managed through Terraform data sources and explicit dependency declarations. This ensures that updates to shared resources propagate correctly to dependent services without causing deployment failures or service disruptions.

## Network Architecture

### VPC Design Patterns

Each regional deployment utilizes a dedicated VPC with multi-AZ private subnets for Lambda functions and database resources. The network design prioritizes security isolation while enabling efficient service-to-service communication through VPC endpoints and security group rules.

**Subnet Organization**: Private subnets host all Lambda functions and data storage resources, with no public subnets required for the serverless architecture. Each availability zone contains dedicated subnets for different service tiers, enabling granular network ACL policies and traffic flow control.

**VPC Endpoints**: Interface endpoints for AWS services (DynamoDB, S3, KMS, CloudWatch) eliminate internet gateway dependencies and reduce network latency. Gateway endpoints for S3 provide cost-effective access to object storage without data transfer charges.

**Security Group Architecture**: Hierarchical security groups provide defense-in-depth network security. Lambda security groups allow outbound HTTPS for AWS API access, database security groups restrict access to Lambda functions only, and EFS security groups permit NFS access from authorized Lambda functions.

### DNS and Service Discovery

Route 53 private hosted zones provide internal DNS resolution for regional services. Each region maintains its own private zone for internal service endpoints, while global routing logic in Lambda@Edge directs traffic to appropriate regional origins based on tenant home region configuration.

## Lambda Function Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Package Management

Lambda deployment packages are built and managed through automated CI/CD pipelines that ensure consistent runtime environments across all functions. The deployment system supports both container images and ZIP packages based on function complexity and runtime requirements.

**Container-Based Deployment**: Complex functions with significant dependencies utilize container images stored in Amazon ECR. This approach provides consistent runtime environments and simplifies dependency management for functions requiring native libraries or large dependency sets.

**ZIP Package Deployment**: Simpler functions use ZIP packages for faster cold start performance. These packages include only essential dependencies and are optimized for minimal size and initialization time.

### Function Configuration Management

Lambda function configuration follows standardized patterns for memory allocation, timeout settings, environment variables, and execution roles. Configuration templates ensure consistency across similar function types while allowing service-specific customization.

**Environment Variable Management**: Configuration parameters are injected through environment variables with standardized naming conventions. Sensitive configuration data is retrieved from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager during function initialization.

**IAM Role Templates**: Each service type utilizes predefined IAM role templates that provide least-privilege access to required AWS resources. Role templates are parameterized to support tenant-specific resource access patterns while maintaining security boundaries.

### Provisioned Concurrency Management

Critical path functions utilize provisioned concurrency to eliminate cold start latency for tenant-facing operations. Provisioned concurrency allocation is based on traffic patterns and SLA requirements, with automatic scaling policies that adjust capacity based on demand.

The system maintains warm pools for ingest and query functions while allowing background processing functions to scale from zero. This approach balances cost efficiency with performance requirements for different workload patterns.

## Storage Infrastructure

### EFS Filesystem Configuration

Regional EFS filesystems provide hot storage for recent telemetry data with configuration optimized for high-throughput sequential and random access patterns. Each regional deployment includes dedicated EFS filesystems with provisioned throughput to ensure predictable performance characteristics.

**Mount Target Architecture**: Mount targets are deployed across multiple availability zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Lambda functions access EFS through mount targets in their respective availability zones, with automatic failover to alternate zones during outages.

**Access Point Management**: EFS access points provide tenant isolation and security boundaries within shared filesystems. Each tenant receives dedicated access points with POSIX user/group isolation and path-based restrictions that prevent cross-tenant data access.

**Performance Optimization**: Provisioned throughput mode ensures consistent performance during peak load periods. Throughput allocation is calculated based on expected ingestion rates and query patterns, with monitoring and alerting for capacity utilization.

### S3 Bucket Architecture

S3 storage utilizes region-specific buckets for segments and analytics data with lifecycle policies that optimize costs across different access patterns. Bucket configuration includes encryption at rest, versioning for critical data, and cross-region replication for disaster recovery scenarios.

**Bucket Organization**: Separate buckets for segment storage and Parquet analytics data enable different lifecycle policies and access patterns. Segment buckets prioritize availability and fast access, while analytics buckets optimize for cost and long-term retention.

**Lifecycle Management**: Automated lifecycle policies transition data through S3 storage classes based on age and access patterns. Recent data remains in Standard storage, older data transitions to Standard-IA, and archival data moves to Glacier storage classes.

## Database Infrastructure

### Aurora Serverless Configuration

Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL clusters provide metadata storage with automatic scaling based on workload demands. Cluster configuration includes Multi-AZ deployment for high availability, automated backups with point-in-time recovery, and encryption at rest with regional KMS keys.

**Connection Management**: RDS Proxy provides connection pooling and management for Lambda functions accessing Aurora clusters. Proxy configuration includes IAM authentication integration, automatic failover capabilities, and connection limit management to prevent resource exhaustion.

**Read Replica Strategy**: Read-heavy workloads utilize Aurora read replicas to distribute query load and improve performance. Read replicas are automatically provisioned based on connection patterns and query volume metrics.

### DynamoDB Global Table Setup

Tenant registry and idempotency tables utilize DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region consistency and availability. Global table configuration ensures eventual consistency across regions while providing strong consistency within individual regions.

**Capacity Management**: Tables utilize on-demand billing with burst capacity to handle variable workloads without manual capacity planning. Reserved capacity is applied to predictable baseline workloads to optimize costs.

## API Gateway Configuration

### Regional API Deployments

Each region includes dedicated API Gateway deployments that provide regional entry points for tenant traffic. API configuration includes custom domain names, TLS termination, request/response transformation, and integration with Lambda authorizers.

**Throttling and Rate Limiting**: API Gateway implements request throttling based on tenant quotas and system capacity limits. Throttling policies protect backend services from overload while providing fair resource allocation across tenants.

**Logging and Monitoring**: Access logs capture detailed request information for security auditing and performance analysis. CloudWatch integration provides real-time metrics and alerting for API performance and error rates.

### Custom Domain Management

Custom domain names provide stable endpoints for client applications while supporting regional routing and failover scenarios. Domain configuration includes SSL certificate management through AWS Certificate Manager and Route 53 integration for DNS resolution.

## Step Functions State Machine Deployment

### Migration Orchestration

Step Functions state machines coordinate complex multi-step operations including tenant migrations, data lifecycle management, and cross-service orchestration. State machine definitions are deployed through infrastructure templates that ensure consistency across regions.

**Error Handling and Retry Logic**: State machines include comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff retry policies, circuit breaker patterns, and fallback procedures for failed operations. Error states trigger appropriate alerting and manual intervention procedures when automatic recovery is not possible.

**Integration Patterns**: State machines utilize both synchronous and asynchronous integration patterns based on operation requirements. Long-running operations use asynchronous patterns to avoid timeout issues, while critical path operations use synchronous patterns for immediate feedback.

## Monitoring and Observability Infrastructure

### CloudWatch Integration

Comprehensive CloudWatch integration provides metrics, logs, and alarms for all infrastructure components. Custom metrics capture business-specific KPIs while standard AWS metrics monitor infrastructure health and performance.

**Log Aggregation**: CloudWatch Logs centralizes log data from all services with standardized log formats and retention policies. Log groups are organized by service and region to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

**Alerting Framework**: CloudWatch Alarms monitor critical metrics with appropriate thresholds and notification channels. Alert escalation policies ensure that critical issues receive immediate attention while minimizing false positive notifications.

### Distributed Tracing

AWS X-Ray provides distributed tracing capabilities across Lambda functions and AWS services. Trace collection captures request flows through the system, enabling performance analysis and bottleneck identification.

## Deployment Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

Automated deployment pipelines manage infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and configuration updates across multiple environments and regions. Pipeline stages include validation, testing, approval gates, and progressive rollout strategies.

**Environment Promotion**: Infrastructure changes progress through development, staging, and production environments with appropriate validation and approval gates. Each environment maintains isolation while sharing common configuration templates.

**Rollback Capabilities**: Deployment pipelines include automated rollback procedures for failed deployments. Rollback operations restore previous infrastructure states and application versions while maintaining data consistency.

### Configuration Management

Centralized configuration management ensures consistency across environments and regions while supporting environment-specific customization. Configuration templates utilize parameter substitution and conditional logic to support different deployment scenarios.

**Secret Management**: Sensitive configuration data is managed through AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation policies and secure access patterns. Secrets are scoped to specific services and environments to minimize exposure risk.

This infrastructure architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for the Prism analytics platform while maintaining operational simplicity and cost efficiency through serverless design patterns.
