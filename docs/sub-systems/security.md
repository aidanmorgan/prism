## Authentication and Authorization

### API Key Authentication Architecture

The platform implements a multi-layered API key authentication system that provides secure tenant identification while maintaining high performance for high-throughput telemetry ingestion.

#### API Key Structure and Lifecycle

API keys follow a structured format with cryptographically secure random generation and embedded metadata that enables efficient validation and tenant resolution. Each key includes a recognizable prefix for platform identification, sufficient entropy for security, and associated tenant metadata stored separately in the tenant registry.

The key structure supports both authentication and authorization by linking to tenant-specific permissions and rate limiting configurations. This design enables fine-grained access control while maintaining the simplicity required for telemetry instrumentation.

#### Request Authentication Flow

Authentication follows a multi-stage validation process that balances security with performance requirements. Initial validation checks key format and basic structure without external dependencies, enabling rapid rejection of malformed requests.

Subsequent validation stages involve tenant registry lookups with caching strategies that minimize database load while ensuring current access control policies. The authentication flow includes timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks and signature verification for request integrity.

#### HMAC Signature Validation

Request integrity is ensured through HMAC signatures that cover method, path, timestamp, and body content. The signature scheme provides protection against tampering while enabling efficient validation without requiring complex cryptographic operations.

Signature validation includes timing attack protection through constant-time comparison operations and replay protection through timestamp freshness requirements. The HMAC approach provides strong security guarantees while maintaining compatibility with standard HTTP client libraries.

### Lambda Authorizer Architecture

#### Regional Authorization Patterns

The Lambda Authorizer implements a sophisticated authorization system that validates API keys, enforces tenant isolation, and manages regional access policies. The authorizer operates as a gateway function that processes all incoming requests before they reach application logic.

**Multi-Source API Key Extraction**: The authorizer supports multiple API key presentation methods including Authorization headers with Bearer tokens, custom x-api-key headers, and query string parameters. This flexibility accommodates different client integration patterns while maintaining consistent security validation.

**Tenant Context Resolution**: Successful API key validation triggers tenant context resolution that retrieves tenant metadata, shard assignments, and access policies from the tenant registry. This context information is propagated to downstream services through request headers, enabling tenant-aware processing throughout the system.

**Regional Access Control**: The authorizer enforces data residency policies by validating that requests are processed in appropriate regions based on tenant configuration. Strict residency policies limit processing to home regions, while permitted policies allow explicitly configured secondary regions.

#### Caching and Performance Optimization

The authorization system implements intelligent caching strategies that balance security requirements with performance needs. Lambda memory caching provides rapid access to frequently used tenant information while respecting cache TTL limits that ensure policy updates propagate appropriately.

Cache invalidation occurs automatically based on time-based expiration, while cache warming strategies preload frequently accessed tenant data. The caching design prevents cache stampede scenarios while ensuring consistent authorization decisions across concurrent requests.

## Data Encryption Architecture

### Encryption at Rest Strategy

#### Multi-Layer Encryption Design

The platform implements comprehensive encryption at rest using AWS KMS with regional key management that ensures data protection while supporting the multi-tenant architecture. The encryption strategy covers all data storage tiers with appropriate key management and access control policies.

**Regional Key Management**: Each region maintains dedicated KMS keys for different service types, enabling granular access control and supporting data residency requirements. Regional keys ensure that encryption operations remain within appropriate geographic boundaries while maintaining operational independence across regions.

**Service-Specific Key Policies**: KMS key policies are tailored to specific service requirements, granting appropriate permissions to Lambda execution roles, storage services, and administrative functions. The key policies implement least-privilege access principles while enabling necessary cross-service integrations.

**Automatic Key Rotation**: KMS keys are configured with automatic rotation policies that enhance security without requiring manual intervention. Key rotation operates transparently to applications while maintaining access to data encrypted with previous key versions.

#### Service-Specific Encryption Patterns

Each storage service implements encryption using appropriate patterns that balance security requirements with performance characteristics.

**EFS Encryption**: Hot storage utilizes EFS encryption at rest with regional KMS keys, ensuring that columnar data blocks remain protected throughout their lifecycle. Encryption operates transparently to applications while providing comprehensive data protection for recent telemetry data.

**S3 Encryption**: Both warm segment storage and cold Parquet storage implement server-side encryption with KMS keys. S3 bucket encryption policies ensure that all objects are encrypted by default, with bucket key optimization reducing KMS API costs for high-throughput scenarios.

**Aurora Encryption**: The metadata catalog implements transparent data encryption using regional KMS keys, protecting segment metadata, statistics, and trace hints. Encryption extends to automated backups and point-in-time recovery data to maintain comprehensive protection.

**DynamoDB Encryption**: Tenant registry and idempotency tables utilize server-side encryption with KMS integration, ensuring that tenant metadata and operational state remain protected across all regions.

### Encryption in Transit

#### TLS Architecture and Certificate Management

The platform implements comprehensive encryption in transit using TLS 1.2+ for all communications between clients and services, as well as inter-service communications within the AWS infrastructure.

**Certificate Management Strategy**: Regional wildcard certificates provide TLS termination for all platform endpoints within each region. Certificates are managed through AWS Certificate Manager with automated DNS validation and renewal, ensuring continuous protection without manual intervention.

**API Gateway TLS Configuration**: All API endpoints enforce strong TLS policies with modern cipher suites and minimum TLS version requirements. The configuration prioritizes security while maintaining compatibility with standard HTTP clients and telemetry libraries.

**Service-to-Service Communication**: Internal communications between AWS services utilize AWS's encrypted service endpoints and VPC configurations that ensure data remains encrypted during transit between platform components.

## Network Security

### VPC Security Architecture

#### Network Isolation Patterns

The platform implements comprehensive network security through VPC isolation, security groups, and network ACLs that provide defense-in-depth protection for all components. The network architecture ensures that only authorized communications occur between services while maintaining the performance requirements for high-throughput telemetry processing.

**VPC Isolation Design**: Each regional deployment utilizes dedicated VPCs with private subnets for all application components. The network design eliminates public IP addresses for application resources while providing controlled internet access through NAT gateways for necessary external communications.

**Security Group Architecture**: Hierarchical security groups implement fine-grained access control between service tiers. Lambda functions, database resources, and storage systems each operate within dedicated security groups with minimal required permissions for inter-service communication.

**VPC Endpoint Integration**: Interface and gateway VPC endpoints provide private connectivity to AWS services, eliminating the need for internet gateway traversal for service API calls. This design reduces attack surface while improving performance and reliability for platform operations.

### Tenant Isolation Architecture

The platform implements comprehensive tenant isolation through multiple security mechanisms that ensure complete data and compute separation between tenants while maintaining operational efficiency.

#### IAM-Based Isolation Patterns

The platform uses IAM roles and policies to enforce tenant isolation at the compute and storage layers. Each tenant operates within dedicated IAM contexts that prevent cross-tenant access while enabling necessary platform operations.

**Tenant-Specific Execution Roles**: Lambda functions operate under tenant-scoped IAM roles that grant access only to the specific tenant's data and resources. These roles implement path-based restrictions for S3 access, EFS access point limitations, and DynamoDB partition key constraints.

**Resource-Level Access Control**: IAM policies implement fine-grained resource access patterns that enforce tenant boundaries at the AWS service level. S3 bucket policies restrict access to tenant-specific prefixes, EFS access points provide filesystem-level isolation, and DynamoDB policies enforce partition key restrictions.

**Least Privilege Principles**: All IAM roles follow least-privilege access patterns that grant only the minimum permissions required for specific operations. This approach minimizes potential security exposure while maintaining operational functionality.

#### Data Isolation Mechanisms

**EFS Access Point Isolation**: Each tenant receives dedicated EFS access points that provide POSIX-level isolation with tenant-specific root directories and user/group mappings. This approach ensures that filesystem-level operations cannot cross tenant boundaries even if application-level controls fail.

**S3 Prefix-Based Isolation**: Object storage implements tenant isolation through carefully designed prefix patterns combined with IAM policy restrictions. Each tenant's data resides within dedicated S3 prefixes that are enforced through both IAM policies and application-level access controls.

**Database Row-Level Security**: Aurora implements tenant isolation through row-level security policies that filter data access based on tenant context. This approach ensures that database queries automatically exclude data from other tenants regardless of application-level filtering.

## Data Residency Enforcement

### Regional Data Boundaries

The platform implements comprehensive data residency controls that ensure tenant data remains within specified geographic regions according to regulatory and business requirements.

**Strict Residency Mode**: Tenants configured with strict residency policies have their data processing limited to their designated home region. Cross-region operations are blocked at the API gateway level, ensuring complete geographic data containment.

**Permitted Residency Mode**: This mode allows processing in explicitly approved secondary regions while maintaining audit trails of all cross-region data access. Data replication to secondary regions follows controlled procedures with appropriate encryption and access controls.

**Residency Validation**: All data operations include residency validation that verifies compliance with tenant-specific policies before processing. This validation occurs at multiple system layers to ensure comprehensive enforcement.
